# 1. Introduction to OOP & Java Basics

---

## What is OOP?

- **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
- **Key OOP Principles:** Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.

---

## Why Java for OOP?

- Java is a pure object-oriented language (almost everything is an object).
- Platform-independent via the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- Strongly typed and secure, with automatic memory management (Garbage Collection).

## Java Basics

| Concept           | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Class             | Blueprint for creating objects                                              |
| Object            | Instance of a class                                                         |
| Method            | Block of code that performs an action                                       |
| Variable          | Container for storing data values                                           |
| Constructor       | Special method to initialize objects                                        |
| Package           | Group of related classes and interfaces                                     |
| JVM               | Java Virtual Machine; executes Java bytecode                                |
| JDK/JRE           | Java Development Kit / Java Runtime Environment                             |

## Java Program Structure

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

---

## How Java Code Runs

1. **Write:** Source code (.java file)
2. **Compile:** `javac HelloWorld.java` → Bytecode (.class file)
3. **Execute:** `java HelloWorld` (JVM executes the bytecode)

## Features of Java

- Simple, Object-Oriented, Platform Independent, Secure, Robust, Distributed, Portable, Multithreaded, High Performance.

## Difference: OOP vs. POP (Procedural)

| OOP                           | POP (Procedural)              |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Based on objects/classes      | Based on procedures/functions |
| Emphasizes data + methods     | Emphasizes functions          |
| Encapsulation, inheritance    | No encapsulation/inheritance  |
| Example: Java, C++            | Example: C, Pascal            |
